                Welcome to my blog! Today, we are going to learn the basics of Redis. Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker.
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                Redis supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more.
                <h3>Step 1: Installation</h3>
                To install Redis, follow the instructions on the official website. Installation is straightforward and varies slightly depending on your operating system.
                <h3>Step 2: Basic Commands</h3>
                Here are some basic commands to get you started with Redis:
                <pre>
                    SET key value;
                    GET key;
                    DEL key;
                </pre>
                Redis is now ready to use. You can start storing and retrieving data efficiently.
                That's it for today's tutorial. Stay tuned for more!
